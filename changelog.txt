0.1.2 - [2015/06/22] - Added simple Detail system similar to what is already in place for Header/Footers.
1.0.0 - Fixed several edge cases of Header/Footer and printing sizing issues.  Reports should now ALWAYS print headers/footers properly.

Breaking changes or API inconsistencies:
    In v0.1.2 bandField functionality was removed.  This "feature" didn't make sense since simple detail abilities are now supported which are much more powerful, and those still needing bandField like ability can easily emulate it in their own code...
    In v1.0.0 parent & current Headers now have the ability to be printed only ONCE (old behavior), On all new Pages (new default for the current header), and Always.
