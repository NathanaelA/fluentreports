Breaking changes or API inconsistencies:
    In v0.1.2 bandField functionality was removed.  This "feature" didn't make sense since simple detail abilities
        are now supported which are much more powerful, and those still needing bandField like ability can easily
        emulate it in their own code by creating a array and pushing the fields to it before calling band with it...
    In v1.0.0 parent & current Headers now have the ability to be printed only ONCE (old behavior), On all new Pages
        (new default for the current header), and Always.
    In v1.0.0 when print(['hi','','testing']) the old code would ignore the '' in the middle of the array so you
        would just get two lines.  The new code will print '' in arrays and give you three lines.   If you want the
        old behavior pass {ignoreEmptyStrings:true} to print routine.
    In v1.0.3 Totaling system now treat NaN and null values as 0.
