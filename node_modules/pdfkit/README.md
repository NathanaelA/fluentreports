# PDFKit
A PDF generation library for Node.js.

## Description

PDFKit is a PDF document generation library for Node that makes creating complex, multi-page, printable documents easy. It is written in pure CoffeeScript, but you can choose to use the API in plain 'ol JavaScript if you like. The API embraces chainability, and includes both low level functions as well as abstractions for higher level functionality. The PDFKit API is designed to be simple, so generating complex documents is often as simple as a few function calls. Check out some of the 
[documentation and examples](http://devongovett.github.com/pdfkit/docs/getting_started.html) to see for yourself!

## Installation

Installation uses the [npm](http://npmjs.org/) package manager.  Just type the following command after installing npm.

    npm install pdfkit

## Example

    PDFDocument = require 'pdfkit'
    doc = new PDFDocument

    # Embed a font, set the font size, and render some text
    doc.font('fonts/PalatinoBold.ttf')
       .fontSize(25)
       .text('Some text with an embedded font!', 100, 100)

    # Add another page
    doc.addPage()
       .fontSize(25)
       .text('Here is some vector graphics...', 100, 100)

    # Draw a triangle
    doc.save()
       .moveTo(100, 150)
       .lineTo(100, 250)
       .lineTo(200, 250)
       .fill("#FF3300")

    # Apply some transforms and render an SVG path with the 'even-odd' fill rule
    doc.scale(0.6)
       .translate(470, -380)
       .path('M 250,75 L 323,301 131,161 369,161 177,301 z')
       .fill('red', 'even-odd')
       .restore()

    # Add some text with annotations
    doc.addPage()
       .fillColor("blue")
       .text('Here is a link!', 100, 100)
       .underline(100, 100, 160, 27, color: "#0000FF")
       .link(100, 100, 160, 27, 'http://google.com/')

    # Write the PDF file to disk
    doc.write 'output.pdf'
     
[The PDF output from this example](http://devongovett.github.com/pdfkit/example.pdf) (with a few additions) shows the power of PDFKit â€” producing 
complex documents with a very small amount of code.  For more, see the `demo` folder and the 
[PDFKit programming guide](http://devongovett.github.com/pdfkit/docs/getting_started.html).
